## Reflection

- **Challenge:**  
  Managing application state fully on the frontend without a backend or frameworks.

- **What I’d improve with more time:**
  - Add **localStorage** to persist data between refreshes
  - Implement **Edit Employee** functionality
  - Modularize UI components
  - Enhance filtering with a sidebar or modal
  - Add better UX feedback (toasts, loading states, etc.)

---

## Notes

- No backend or Freemarker used — this version is static.
- Can be hosted easily on GitHub Pages or Netlify.

---

- Simple. Clean. Responsive.  
  This project demonstrates the fundamentals of modern frontend development without relying on heavy tools.
